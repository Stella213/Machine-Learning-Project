# machine-learning project on bank service
The project has several goals:

First, it provides business research on current/future Bill Pay customers (adopters/non-adopters), explore customers' needs, assess their pain points, and find the gap between the current Bill Pay product and the customer's desired product.

Second, it builds a machine learning system that predicts current non-Bill Pay bank customersâ€™ likelihood of becoming a Bill Pay customer, which helps Customer Engagement Engine (CEE) to deliver personalized Next Best Actions for each customer across digital channels, branches, and call centers.

Thirdly, it provides findings and recommendations based on triangulated research and analytics results.
